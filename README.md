## Mini Sql

a mini sql parser written by JS. Purely hand written and dependent on parser_combinator_lib,which is also in my github.

So far it just add little and simplified sql grammer.

If you input wrong sql statement, it can find the last matched token, and find all next legal token according to that token. So it supports sql intellisense to some degree LOL. Just a joke.
